# 🧠 ResuCluster: AI-Driven Resume Clustering Using LLMs

**📅 Duration:** September 2024 – January 2025  
**👩‍💻 Developed by:** Mareddy Akhila

## 🚀 Project Overview

**ResuCluster** is an AI-powered system designed to automate and enhance the resume analysis and clustering process. Traditional keyword-based filtering in recruitment is often limited and inefficient. ResuCluster leverages advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques to **cluster resumes by contextual similarity**, enabling more intelligent candidate-job role matching.


## 🎯 Key Features

- ✅ Automated **resume parsing** and **context-aware clustering**
- ✅ Uses **TF-IDF**, **word embeddings**, and **sentence transformers** for feature extraction
- ✅ Clustering using:
  - **K-Means**
  - **DBSCAN**
  - **Hierarchical Clustering**
- ✅ Visualizes clusters for recruiter insights
- ✅ Improves recruitment efficiency and accuracy by overcoming traditional filtering limitations
